# Hedera AI Agent Kit

Build LLM-powered applications that interact directly with the **Hedera Network**.
Create conversational agents that understand natural language and execute Hedera transactions,
or build backend systems that leverage AI for on-chain operations.

---

##  Overview

The **Hedera Agent Kit** provides:

- **Conversational AI** — LangChain-based agents that understand natural language commands and execute Hedera operations
- **Adaptors for Framework Tools** — Pre-built tools covering Hedera services (and third-party plugins), automatically adapted into popular frameworks like **LangChain**, **Vercel AI SDK**, and **MCP**
- **Flexible Transaction Handling** — Execute directly or provide transaction bytes for user signing in wallets
- **Execution Modes** — Autonomous or Human-in-the-Loop transaction execution with approval workflows
- **Plugin Architecture** — Extend Hedera network capabilities with both native and third-party features
- **Multi-Agent Support** — Build systems where multiple AI agents communicate and transact with each other

##  Key Features

###  Natural Language Interface
Ask your agent in plain English:
- "Transfer 10 HBAR to account 0.0.12345"
- "Create a new topic for my blog posts"
- "What's my account balance?"
- "Deploy a smart contract to testnet"

###  Comprehensive Hedera Service Coverage
- **HBAR Transfers** — Send and receive cryptocurrency
- **Token Service** — Create, mint, burn, and transfer fungible/NFT tokens
- **Consensus Service** — Submit and query topic messages
- **Smart Contracts** — Deploy and interact with Solidity contracts
- **File Service** — Store and retrieve files on-chain
- **Account Management** — Create accounts, check balances, get info

###  Framework Integrations
- **LangChain** — Build conversational AI agents
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Connect AI models to Hedera services

###  Security & Control
- **Transaction Preview** — Review transactions before execution
- **User Approval Workflows** — Human-in-the-loop for sensitive operations
- **Private Key Management** — Secure credential handling
- **Testnet/Mainnet Support** — Safe development and production deployment
